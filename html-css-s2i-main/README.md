## 📝 Project Description

This project is all about building a clean, modern, and mobile-first website. I structured the content using HTML and styled it with CSS, enhanced by **Sass** to simplify and organize my code.

### 🎯 **Key Features:**
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Prioritizing a seamless mobile experience.
- **Clean, Maintainable Code**: Thanks to the power of Sass with variables, mixins, and nesting.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- **HTML**: Structured the website's content using semantic elements.
- **CSS**: Defined the look and feel of the site, from colors to layout.
- **Sass**: Streamlined CSS writing with variables, mixins, and more advanced features.

## 📂 **Project Structure**

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that structures the entire website.
- **`styles.scss`**: The Sass file where I wrote all the styling rules.
- **`assets/`**: Contains images and other media used throughout the site.
- **`css/`**: Houses the compiled CSS file generated by Sass.
